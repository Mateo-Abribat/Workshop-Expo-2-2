# Setup

## Essential components

First, install all essential components for React Native and Expo:

1. Yarn (recommended) or npm
   - Link to install yarn [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
2. Node.js if it is not already installed.

## Create app

1. Use either Yarn or npm to create your app with the following command:

```
yarn create expo-app AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
```

\*Note: Replace `AwesomeProject` with a personal name.

## Main file

1. The main file to be used is `App.js`, located in the project directory.

## Test app

1. There are two options to test the app:

- Option 1 (recommended): Install the `Expo Go` app from Google Play Store or Apple Store.
- Option 2: Install Android Studio for Android Virtual Device (AVD) emulation.

\*Note: This option is more complex and may require additional setup.

2. To run the basic code, use the following command:

```
yarn expo start
```

- For `Expo Go` app: scan the QR code from the terminal to launch the project on the app.
- For Android Studio: press "A" on the terminal and launch the project on the emulator.

## Final result

Upon successful launch, the app should display the following screen :
